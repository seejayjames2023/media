        <h1>Chicago CTK Trip!</h1>
        <strong>This is the home page of my Creative Technologies-inspired trip to Chicago!</strong><br>
        I visited a bunch of cool places: the Museum of Science and Industry, the Adler Planetarium, the WNDR museum,
        and a Gem/Mineral museum.<br>
        Got LOTS of ideas for projects we could make in Creative Technologies 😁<br><br>
        Obligatory picture of the city skyline...plus the car I rented<br>

        <div class="sideText">I'm trying a new approach for this web page: a Single Page
            Application (SPA).<br>
            All the content is in chunks of HTML, all CSS is included, and all media is linked, so no separate files
            need to go with the HTML file.<br>
            When you use the nav buttons, the existing content is hidden and the new content (inside its own div) is
            loaded.<br>
            The effect is a site with multiple pages, but there's just one file. Super easy to share!<br><br>

        Pretty straightforward to do these with a camera and some image processing to detect the high-contrast shadow

        Then, use the shadow area as a collider in Unity/Unreal or use p5.js with a physics library.<br>

        <strong>Photogrammetry!</strong><br><br>
        Take lots of pictures of a real-world object
        from different overlapping angles, then use software (I'm using RealityScan by Epic, free) to stitch
        them together and create a 3D model. Note that this differs from 3D scanning with LIDAR or depth cameras, which
        is better for determining space in larger areas like rooms or buildings (but not as good for texture
        detail).<br><br>
        I'm planning to write up and make videos of the workflow so others can try it too---capture sculpture, props,
        costumes, etc and use
        the models in game engines if you want, put them in your portfolio, etc. The results are really impressive
        (amazing detail and textures) and the process doesn't take long.<br><br>
        On the trip I found a dozen or so interesting objects to try this on. Here's a music room in a giant "Fairy
        Castle" exhibit.
        This was only six pictures and it was through glass, so it wasn't ideal, but the model still looks pretty great,
        <strong>check out the video!</strong><br>

        <strong>VR experience: Cosmic Coaster...not for the faint of stomach!</strong><br><br>
        I didn't try this here, but I did try a similar roller coaster VR experience at an arcade later in the
        trip........<br>
        <strong>and for the first time in VR, I got motion sickness! UGH!</strong><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/seejayjames2023/media/blob/main/images/chicagoTrip/VR_cosmos_coaster.png?raw=true"
            target="_blank">
            <img
                src="https://github.com/seejayjames2023/media/blob/main/images/chicagoTrip/VR_cosmos_coaster.png?raw=true"></a><br>
        So I spent awhile researching about exactly why it happens, and it's not just "VR makes you
        sick"...there are a LOT of factors involved, and <strong>these are critical for designers.</strong><br><br>
        The main idea is that motion sickness happens when your brain gets conflicting signals from your eyes, your
        inner ear (which senses motion), and your proprioceptors (which sense body position).<br>
        In VR, your eyes see the virtual world moving but the other two systems don't (you're sitting still, or
        there's simulated motion in the chair but it doesn't match the visuals well). This conflict can lead to nausea,
        dizziness, headaches, etc. And because it's fully immersive, the effect is FAR stronger than with traditional
        screens--no reference point for the mind to "ground" itself.<br>
        <strong>If you find this happening, immediately close your eyes---the visual sense is by far the strongest, so
            the disconnect will be much less.</strong> Even though the chair might be moving (which is disorienting with
        eyes closed), the visual disconnect is the main cause. Then stop the ride asap and when you're able, walk around
        and
        get fresh air.<br><br>
        Even though I bailed out before it got too bad, it took quite awhile before I felt recovered.
        <strong>This was quite the lesson about how important good design is for user comfort in VR!</strong><br><br>

        <hr>
        <br>

        <div class="sideText" style="font-size:larger">To reduce motion sickness in VR experiences, designers can use
            these techniques:</div><br>
        <div class="sideText">
            - Minimize rapid or unnatural movements in the virtual environment<br>
            - Use teleportation or "blink" movement and rotation, especially if it has acceleration<br>
            - Provide a stable reference frame (like a cockpit or vehicle interior)<br>
            - Limit the field of view during fast movements (your peripheral vision is very sensitive to motion)<br>
            - Give users more control over movement and rotation speed instead of allowing the camera to move and rotate
            on its own<br>
            - Movement is generally less disorienting than rotation<br>
            - Rotation can be QUITE disorienting, generally in this order from least to most:<br>
            - - Pitch (tilt head up/down)<br>
            - - Yaw (turn head left/right)<br>
            - - Roll (tilt head left/right)<br>
            - Combining two axes of rotation (like pitch + roll) can make users nauseous in no time, especially if there
            are no reference elements and/or the user is not controlling it<br>
            - Ensure high frame rates and low latency to reduce visual lag<br><br>

        I did the 3D model/photogrammetry process on this, using the few pictures I could get without
        moving it (obviously hehe).<br>
        My idea was to take the model into Unity and make a game where you have a ship and explore the
        meteorite up
        close <strong>as though it's a much larger asteroid.</strong><br>

        Here's a video flyby to give a feel for gameplay. I put a simple script on the camera to move it
        forward, then modified the
        material settings (using the Inspector, not seen) in realtime.<br>

        Here are some shots of different materials applied to the model in Unity, showing how different the look can be
        depending on the settings like <strong>base texture, color, and emission.</strong> As you see in the
        video, all these settings can be modified in realtime or because of user input, events, timers, etc. There's
        literally no limit to the kinds of effects and interactions you can create...and using photogrammetry, you can
        bring in all sorts of real-world objects and spaces!<br>
